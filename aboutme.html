  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <p>Raised and born in Louisville, Kentucky. I attended Fern Creek Traditional High School were I really tried my passion in the things that I found I love doing. I'm a two year ROTC, Art, Business and Computer Programming Student-- which is a reason why I didn't graduate with a focused degree-- which should technically have been leadership and art.</p>
  <p>Truth be told, the Aetherial is a project that I have steadily worked on for a long time now. It used to be my alter ego going into fictional places and ended up being a cyberpunk crime novel. Due to some things happening-- and the spite of magic and technology not being able to coexist in most setting its the reason why it is... what it is.</p>
  <p>I'm a gamer and purveyor of foods! I've always said that if I never ended up gaming I'd likely be a gearhead which is why engineering is a passion of mine--</p>
