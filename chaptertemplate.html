    <p>Olivia was more than worried, her neighbor, an old guardsmen had kept watch over them as they slept. The criminals that sundered control over the city were more than vile-- they were fueling propaganda and inciting rebellion. She never wished for it to happen but they had established alliances and attacked the guardsmen when they were most vulnerable. She sighed as she held her daughter close to her chest. She needed to stay strong to show that another day could happen. That they wouldn't perish due to the misgivings of man.</p>
